# Creating Stories

Creating stories is simple. Stories are **ModuleScripts** that tell UI Labs how to render your UI.

In order for UI Labs to recognize these **ModuleScripts** their names need to end with .story

### Writing Stories

You can write stories in two ways: **[Function Stories](function)** and **[UI Labs Stories](uilabs)**

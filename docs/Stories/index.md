# Creating Stories

Creating stories is simple. Stories are **ModuleScripts** that tell UI-Labs how to render a UI

In order for UI-Labs to recognize these **ModuleScripts**, they must have a name that ends with .story


### Writing Stories

You can write stories in two ways: **[Function Stories](function)** and **[UI Labs Stories](uilabs)**

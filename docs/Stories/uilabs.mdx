# UI-Labs Stories

This Story is more advanced, it is mounted internally by **UI-Labs** with your **Roact** library, allowing UI-Labs to have more control over the Story

This type of Story also allows you to add [Controls](../Controls/index.md) to edit the props of your Story in real-time without changing the code

### Creating UI-Labs Stories

In order to have support for **[Flipbook](https://flipbook-labs.github.io/flipbook/)** and make migration easier, UI-Labs uses almost the same format as Flipbook, allowing you to use flipbook _Stories_ and _Storybooks_ in UI-Labs, also supporting [Flipbook Controls](https://flipbook-labs.github.io/flipbook/docs/writing-stories#controls)

> This has some key **differences**:
>
> - The `Roact`/`React`/`ReactRoblox` library should only be provided within the Story.
>   It cannot be given globally in the Storybook.
>   This limitation exists because UI-Labs would need to _Hot-Reload_ the storybook with the same `_G` global table environment. **This limitation can be solved in the future with a more advanced Hot-Reloader**.
> - The `name` key cannot be provided within a Story, but only within a Storybook.
>   This limitation exists because UI-Labs would need to perform a _Hot-Reload_ operation on every Story to retrieve the name and detect changes.
>   Therefore, the Module Name will always be utilized.

### Story Format

This type of Story should return a **Dictionary** with the following keys inside:

:::caution UI Library not Provided
If no library is provided, UI-Labs will use it's internal's roact library (**This is not recommended**)

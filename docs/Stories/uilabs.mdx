# UI Labs Stories

This type of story is more advanced. It is mounted internally by **UI Labs** with your **Roact/React** library, allowing UI Labs to have more control over the story

This type of story also allows you to add [Controls](../Controls/index.md) to edit the props of your story in real-time without changing the code

### Creating UI Labs Stories

In order to have support for **[Flipbook](https://flipbook-labs.github.io/flipbook/)** and make migration easier, UI Labs uses almost the same format as Flipbook, allowing you to use flipbook _Stories_ and _Storybooks_ in UI Labs, also supporting [Flipbook Controls](https://flipbook-labs.github.io/flipbook/docs/writing-stories#controls)

> This has some key **differences**:
>
> -  The `Roact`/`React`/`ReactRoblox` library should only be provided within the Story.
>    It cannot be given globally in the Storybook.
>    This limitation exists because UI Labs would need to Hot-Reload the storybook with a shared environment. **This limitation can be solved in the future with a more advanced Hot-Reloader**.
>
> -  The `name` key cannot be provided within a story, but only within a Storybook. <br></br>
>    This limitation exists because UI Labs would need to perform a Hot-Reload operation on **every single** story to retrieve the name and detect changes which can be expensive and unnecessary.
>    Therefore, the module name will always be utilized.

### Story Format

This Type of Story should return a **Dictionary** with the following keys inside:

| Key      | Type                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| story    | `Roact.Element` \| <br></br>`(props: {}) => Roact.Element` | Element to mount, can be either a `Roact Element` or a function that accepts props and returns the element that will be mounted                 |
| name     | string?                                                    | Ignored by UI Labs (`script.Name` is always used), included here for Flipbook compatibility                                                     |
| summary  | string?                                                    | Optional description of your story. This description supports [Rich text](https://create.roblox.com/docs/ui/rich-text)                          |
| controls | StoryControls?                                             | Optional [Controls](../Controls/index.md) to see how your UI behaves with different props                                                       |
| cleanup  | `() => void`?                                              | Optional cleanup function that gets executed before the Story is unmounted. (Roact unmounting is done automatically and shouldn't be done here) |

### Providing your library

Providing your library that will be used for mounting is necessary. So additionally you also need these keys depending on your library

> #### Roact
>
> | Key   | Description                                                                                                   |
> | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | roact | Your roact library. `Roact.mount(element) => Roact.Tree` and `Roact.unmount(Roact.Tree)` functions are needed |

---

> #### React & React-Roblox
>
> | Key         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
> | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | react       | Your react library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
> | reactRoblox | Your react-roblox library. `ReactRoblox.createRoot()` and/or `ReactRoblox.createLegacyRoot()` functions are needed.<br></br><br></br> These functions need to return a `Root` that has the methods `Root:render(element)` and `Root:unmount()`                        |
> | renderer    | **(optional)** The type of renderer that will be used **( `deferred` or `legacy` )** (`deferred` is default). <br></br><br></br> • `deferred`: `ReactRoblox.createRoot()` will be used. <br></br><br></br> • `legacy`: `ReactRoblox.createLegacyRoot()` will be used. |

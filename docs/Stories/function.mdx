# Function Stories

These stories are the simplest and they are used by **[hoarcekat](https://www.roblox.com/library/4621580428/Hoarcekat)**.

These are functions returned by the story module that UI-Labs executes passing the **Frame** where they need to be displayed, expecting them to mount the User Interface.

Once executed, these functions must return another function that cleans up the UI, usually calling `Roact.unmount()`

### Using Roact

This is an example of how a function Story can be written with **Roact**

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="lua" label="Luau">

```lua
   --HelloText.story.lua
   local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
   local Roact = require(ReplicatedStorage.Roact)

   return function (target: Frame)
      local element = Roact.createElement("TextLabel", {
         Text = "Hello UI-LABS!",
         TextColor3 = Color3.new(1,1,1),
         BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(0.3, 0.3, 0.3),
         TextSize = 20,
         Size = UDim2.fromOffset(300, 50),
      })
      local handle = Roact.mount(element, target) --We mount inside target

      --We need to return another function to unmount the handle
      return function()
         Roact.unmount(handle)
      end
   end
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="ts" label="Roblox-TS">

```ts
//HelloText.story.ts
import Roact from "@rbxts/roact";

export = (target: Frame) => {
  const element = Roact.createElement("TextLabel", {
    Text: "Hello UI-LABS!",
    TextColor3: new Color3(1, 1, 1),
    BackgroundColor3: new Color3(0.3, 0.3, 0.3),
    TextSize: 20,
    Size: UDim2.fromOffset(300, 50),
  });
  const handle = Roact.mount(element, target); //We mount inside target

  //We need to return another function to unmount the handle
  return () => {
    Roact.unmount(handle);
  };
};
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Fusion Support
UI-Labs currently does not support [Fusion](https://elttob.uk/Fusion/0.2/) natively, therefore, this is the only way you can visualize a Fusion story.
However, native support for Fusion is planned in further updates
:::

:::danger Story Erroring
The clean up function will not be executed if the returned function errors. If this happens, a **Studio restart** may be needed to avoid memory leaks and non-destroyed Instances

# Controls

UI Labs let's you add **Controls** where you can specify configurable values that you can modify while visualizing your interface. This is useful for testing different values for your components without needing to modify your code.

You can use [Flipbook's Controls](https://flipbook-labs.github.io/flipbook/docs/writing-stories#controls) with UI Labs out of the box, but UI Labs allows for more customization and advanced controls.

# Visualizing your Story

We have our beautiful Text here!
but it's at the corner and it's too small so lets fix that.

## Moving your view

You can move your canvas by holding Ctrl and Click-Dragging. Your mouse icon will change to a cross, after this you can click and drag the view to move your Story, Let's place it at the center

Great!, but now it's too small so, let's fix that too

## Zooming In-Out

You can zoom in and out with the Magnifying glasses at the side. Make your text bigger by clicking them

You can also hold Shift and use the scroll wheel to zoom without needing to use the buttons

:::caution Scaling Different Interfaces
   UI-Labs uses UIScale to zoom in/out. Depending on how you set up your UI, zooming might not result in an accurate scaling

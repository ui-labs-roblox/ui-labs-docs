# Storybooks

UI Labs lets you create **Storybooks** for your UI components. Storybooks are a great way to organize your stories in special folders called "Books".

By default, all stories are grayed out, labeled as unknown. While you can use them as they are, it's recommended to organize them in books.

## Creating a Storybook

Similar to stories, UI Labs searches for ModuleScripts but with a `.storybook` name instead.

## Storybook Format

In order to have support for Flipbook **[Storybooks](https://flipbook-labs.github.io/flipbook/docs/writing-stories#storybook)**, UI Labs uses almost the same format as flipbook.

> This has some key **differences**:
>
> -  You cannot provide the UI Library globally here, you must provide it in each story. This limitation might be solved in the future
> -  A `groupRoots` key is added, this can be used to group roots (explained later)

A storybook should return a dictionary with the following keys:

| Key         | Type           | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name        | string?        | Display name for the Storybook, If not given, the Module name will be used instead                                                                   |
| roact       | `Roact?`       | Ignored by UI Labs, specify it in your Story instead, included here for Flipbook compatibility.                                                      |
| react       | `React?`       | Ignored by UI Labs, specify it in your story instead, included here for Flipbook compatibility.                                                      |
| reactRoblox | `ReactRoblox?` | Ignored by UI Labs, specify it in your story instead, included here for Flipbook compatibility.                                                      |
| storyRoots  | `Instance[]`   | Array of Instances where UI Labs will search for stories. Any subfolder will create a subfolder in<br></br> UI Labs too.                             |
| groupRoots  | boolean?       | If true, UI Labs will also create Subfolders for each Instance inside the `storyRoots` array, or if an entry is a story this will display the Story. |

In this case, let's imagine we have this folder structure:

```text title="File structure"
ServerScriptService
├─ GameStories (Folder)
├   ├─ HelloText.story (ModuleScript)
├   └─ HelloText2.story (ModuleScript)
└─ OtherStories (Folder)
    ├─ OtherStory.story (ModuleScript)
    └─ OtherStory2.story (ModuleScript)
```

Let's create a storybook for our Stories.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="lua" label="Luau">

```lua
--MyStorybook.story.lua
return {
   name = "Stories",
   storyRoots = {
      game.ServerScriptService.GameStories,
      game.ServerScriptService.OtherStories,
   },
}
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="ts" label="Roblox-TS">

```ts
//MyStorybook.story.lua
const returnBook = {
   name: "Stories",
   storyRoots: [
      //You might need to typecheck the children first
      game.ServerScriptService.GameStories,
      game.ServerScriptService.OtherStories,
   ],
};

export = returnBook;
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We can now see our stories grouped in our Storybook!

![Storybook](storybook.png)

## Grouping Roots

But what if we want to group our stories based on the Instances we gave in the `storyRoots` array. This allows you to have all your stories organized with a single Storybook if you want, simply provide all your Story folders in `storyRoots`.

We can do that by setting the `groupRoots` key to true.

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="lua" label="Luau">

```lua {8}
--MyStorybook.story.lua
return {
   name = "Stories",
   storyRoots = {
      game.ServerScriptService.GameStories,
      game.ServerScriptService.OtherStories,
   },
   groupRoots = true,
}
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="ts" label="Roblox-TS">

```ts {9}
//MyStorybook.story.lua
const returnBook = {
   name: "Stories",
   storyRoots: [
      //You might need to typecheck the children first
      game.ServerScriptService.GameStories,
      game.ServerScriptService.OtherStories,
   ],
   groupRoots: true,
};

export = returnBook;
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now we have our stories nice and organized!

![StorybookGroup](storybookgrouped.png)

Setting `groupRoots` to true also allows you to provide our stories directly in the `storyRoots` array, this will label all our stories in your Storybook Folder

<Tabs>
   <TabItem value="lua" label="Luau">

```lua {4}
--MyStorybook.story.lua
return {
   name = "Stories",
   storyRoots = game.ServerScriptService.GameStories:GetChildren(),
   groupRoots = true,
}
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="ts" label="Roblox-TS">

```ts {4}
//MyStorybook.story.lua
const returnBook = {
   name: "Stories",
   storyRoots: game.ServerScriptService.GameStories.GetChildren(),
   groupRoots: true,
};

export = returnBook;
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>
